### Day 31: December 6, 2018

**Today's Progress:** Continued with React's tutorial at Scrimba. I enjoy the platform very much. It makes things 'click' faster for me. Also first contact with CSS-in-JS, not a fan... I've done styling in React before but always used an imported CSS file for the components. Will need to learn more about pros and cons of each approach.

**Thoughts:**  Exciting day.
