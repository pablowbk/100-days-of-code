# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: November 4, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Continued with FCC's JavaScript Basics module.

**Thoughts:** Feels like a waste of time going over this again, but I do think I need to get better at the basics before resuming the course at Udemy where we were creating a React app. 

**Link to work:** [Basic JavaScript: Comparison with the Less Than Operator] (https://learn.freecodecamp.org/javascript-algorithms-and-data-structures/basic-javascript/comparison-with-the-less-than-operator)
