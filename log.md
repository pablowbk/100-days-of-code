# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: November 4, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Continued with FCC's JavaScript Basics module.

**Thoughts:** Feels like a waste of time going over this again, but I do think I need to get better at the basics before resuming the course at Udemy where we were creating a React app.

### Day 2: November 5, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Continued with FCC's JavaScript Basics module (2).

**Thoughts:** I really needed to go over these concepts. It was awesome being able to crack the Counting Cards excercise.
